  The peanut butter base is like a chewy, soft peanut butter cookie. It’s so delicious! The swirl of marshmallow fluff adds some sweetness and extra gooey-ness, which I always appreciate. This doesn’t make a huge batch, which is nice because the bars are pretty sweet (from the marshmallow fluff) and pretty rich (from the peanut butter) so a little square goes a long way. Best of all, these babies only require one bowl, making them easy to get into the oven in 5 minutes flat, dirtying very few dishes along the way. My kind of recipe!

    Steps
  </h2>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Step 1: Preheat oven to 350F. Line a 8X8 inch pan with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray; set aside</li>
    <li>Step 2: In a medium size bowl, melt the butter, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Cool butter for about 5 minutes, and then add the egg, peanut butter, sugars, and vanilla. Whisk together throroughly. Add flour and stir until just combined, taking care not to overmix or the bars will be tough. Fold tablespoon size dollops of marshmellow fluff, don't overmix of the fluff will disapear into the batter. You just want some streaks and some small dollops of fluff.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Spread batter into prepared pan, smoothing it lightly with a spatula or offset knife. Bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until cantreis just set. A toothpick should come out mistly clean. Don't overbake; these are meant to be gooey and firm as they cool.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Let cool completely, slice, and enjoy!</li>
